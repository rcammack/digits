 Your index.md should start with a screenshot of the landing page of your application, then provide installation instructions, then provide a walkthrough of the pages in your application and what they do. Your screenshot files can be stored in the doc/ directory.

Commit an initial version of your cleaned up site to the master branch.

Go to the GitHub page for your digits app, and click on “Settings”, then scroll down to the section called “GitHub Pages”. It will say that the repo is private but the published site will be public. This is OK. Select the master branch, then click the Save button.

Now scroll back down to the GitHub pages section, and click the “Choose a theme” button. Select any theme that you want.

Your GitHub page should be available within a few seconds.

Here is the GitHub Page I created for my Digits application: http://philipmjohnson.github.io/digits. Yours can be very similar to this, since you’ve created the same application!

Submission instructions
By the time and date indicated on the Schedule page, submit this assignment via Laulima.

Your submission should contain a link to the GitHub Page you created to document the final user interface to your application.

You should also provide a URL to the GitHub repo so that the TA can check that you have written the index.md file correctly.
